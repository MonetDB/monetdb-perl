NAME

  MonetDB::CLI - MonetDB Call Level Interface

SYNOPSIS

  use MonetDB::CLI();

  my $cxn = MonetDB::CLI->connect( $host, $port, $user, $pass, $lang );

  my $req = $cxn->query('select * from env() env');
  while ( my $cnt = $req->fetch ) {
    print $req->field( $_ ) for 0 .. $cnt-1;
  }

DESCRIPTION

  MonetDB::CLI is a call level interface for MonetDB, somewhat similar
  to SQL/CLI, ODBC, JDBC or DBI.

  Note: In its current incarnation, this interface resembles the MonetDB
  Application Programming Interface.
  In the future, MAPI will be replaced by the MonetDB/Five Communication Layer
  (MCL).
  It is not guaranteed that this call level interface stays the same!

PREREQUISITES

  MonetDB::CLI::* (implementation modules)

  MonetDB (http://www.monetdb.org/)

INSTALLATION

  To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

  You need to use the correct make command. That may be nmake or dmake,
  depending on which development environment you are using.

TESTING

  The supplied tests will connect to the database using some
  environment variables, e.g.:

    set MONETDB_HOST=myhost
    set MONETDB_PORT=4711

  Don't specify port and language (if possible). The server should
  listen on the default ports for sql and mapi.

  If the server doesn't accept the default username/password, then
  set the relevant environment variables, e.g.:

    set MONETDB_USER=test
    set MONETDB_PASS=secret

  Make sure libMapi is in your library search path (depending on the
  MonetDB::CLI implementations in use).
