NAME

  DBD::monetdb - MonetDB Driver for DBI

SYNOPSIS

  use DBI();

  my $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:monetdb:');

  my $sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT * FROM env() env');
  $sth->execute;
  $sth->dump_results;

DESCRIPTION

  DBD::monetdb is a Pure Perl client interface for the MonetDB Database Server.
  It requires MonetDB::CLI (and one of its implementations).

PREREQUISITES

  DBI
  MonetDB::CLI

  MonetDB (http://www.monetdb.org/)

INSTALLATION

  To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

  You need to use the correct make command. That may be nmake or dmake,
  depending on which development environment you are using.

TESTING

  The supplied tests will connect to the database using the DBI
  environment variables, e.g.:

    set DBI_DSN=dbi:monetdb:
    set DBI_DSN=dbi:monetdb:host=localhost

  Don't specify port and language (if possible). The server should
  listen on the default ports for sql and mapi.

  If the server doesn't accept the default username/password, then
  set the relevant environment variables, e.g.:

    set DBI_USER=test
    set DBI_PASS=secret

  Make sure libMapi is in your library search path (depending on the
  MonetDB::CLI implementations in use).

  The tests will create tables with the name (or prefix) 'perl_dbd_test'
  in the current schema.
  Check for the unlikly case that this will cause unwanted side effects!

  To run the tests, type

    make test

  If all tests pass, you'll see something like:

    t/01base.....ok
    ...
    t/75mil......ok
    All tests successful.
    Files=22, Tests=412, 10 wallclock secs ...

  It is possible to run individual test scripts, e.g.:

    perl -w -Mblib t/02cxn.t

  BTW: You can test the ODBC driver when setting the DSN appropriately, e.g.:

    set DBI_DSN=dbi:ODBC:driver=MonetDB ODBC Driver
